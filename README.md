# Ultimate Ecosystem — Complete Guide
### Ultimate Musician (Admin App) + Ultimate Playback (Team App)

---

## Overview

The Ultimate Ecosystem is a two-app worship team management platform:

| App | Role | Platform |
|-----|------|----------|
| **Ultimate Musician** | Admin / Music Director | React Native / Expo SDK 54 |
| **Ultimate Playback** | Team Members | React Native / Expo SDK 54 |
| **Sync Server** | Central hub connecting both apps | Node.js HTTP server |

All real-time data (services, team assignments, messages, blockouts, proposals, song library) flows through the sync server at `http://10.0.0.34:8099`.

---

## Part 1 — Sync Server

### Location
```
/Users/studio/Desktop/sync-server.js
```
Data is persisted to `/Users/studio/Desktop/sync-data.json` automatically on every change.

### Starting the Server
```bash
node /Users/studio/Desktop/sync-server.js
```
The server starts on port **8099**. You should see:
```
Sync server running on port 8099
```

The first screen on launch. Options:
- **Sign In** — Enter email + password
- **Register** — Create a new admin account
- **Continue as Guest** — Limited access

After login, you land on the **Home Screen**.

---

#### 2. Home Screen
The main hub. Contains:
- **Three mode tiles** — CineStage, Organizer, Live Mode

#### 3. Permissions Screen *(new)*
**Path:** Home → 🔐 Permissions pill

**How to use:**
1. Tap the **🔐 Permissions** pill on Home
2. The screen loads all people from the server
3. Each person card shows their name, email, and current role badge:
   - **No badge** = regular team member
   - **MD badge** (purple) = Music Director
   - **Admin badge** (yellow) = Full Admin
4. **Tap any person** to cycle their role: `None → MD → Admin → None`
5. Changes save immediately to the server

**Role explanations:**
- **Music Director (MD):** Can see the full team inbox, create/edit services, manage team assignments, and edit songs from within Playback
- **Admin:** Full admin privileges — same as MD plus all content management

**Effect in Playback app:**
- When a person with MD/Admin role logs in to Playback, they see the **"MD Mode Active"** banner on their Home screen and can access the Admin Dashboard

#### 4. Proposals Screen *(new)*
**Path:** Home → 📝 Proposals pill

Purpose: Review content (lyrics and chord charts) submitted by team members from the Playback app.

**How to use:**
1. Tap **📝 Proposals** pill on Home
2. See all pending proposals listed as cards:
   - Proposer name and email
   - Song title
   - Content type badge: **Lyrics**, **Chord Chart**, or instrument badge (e.g., **🎹 Keys**)
   - Time submitted
3. **Tap a card** to expand it and see:

   - Syncs back to the Musician app's local library
5. **Reject** (red button): Optionally enter a reason; proposal is marked rejected

**Instrument-specific approvals:**
When a team member submits a Keys chart, approving it only updates the Keys part of that song. Other instruments (Guitar, Bass, Drums) keep their own separate charts. All parts live together under the same song.

### Data Flow: How Playback Writes to Musician

When an MD/Admin creates a service or assigns team from the Admin Dashboard:
1. App fetches current full state from `GET /sync/debug`
2. Applies the change locally (adds service, adds team member, etc.)
3. Posts updated state to `POST /sync/publish`
4. Server overwrites and persists
5. Musician app sees the change on next sync/refresh

This is the same pattern used by Musician's admin — both apps are peers with equal write access when the user has the right role.

## Part 6 — Common Issues & Tips

### Server not reachable
- Make sure `sync-server.js` is running: `node /Users/studio/Desktop/sync-server.js`
- Verify the IP: device and server must be on the same Wi-Fi network
- Server IP is hardcoded as `10.0.0.34` — if your Mac's IP changes, update `SYNC_URL` in both apps

### Changes not showing up
- Pull down to refresh in the Playback app HomeScreen
- Pull down to refresh in Musician's relevant screen (Services, People, etc.)
- The server persists everything to `sync-data.json` — data survives server restarts

### Blockout not blocking assignment
- The team member must add their blockout in the **Playback app** (not just locally on device before the fix) — it now pushes to server automatically
- Admin dashboard loads all blockouts at startup, so the warning appears immediately when selecting a person

### Proposal not updating the library
- Proposals only update the library when **Approved** in the Proposals screen — rejected proposals have no effect
- After approval, the Musician app merges the new content into the local song library (AsyncStorage) automatically
- Instrument-specific parts are additive — each instrument is stored independently

### MD/Admin banner not showing in Playback
- Make sure the email in Playback profile matches exactly the email in the Permissions screen grant
- The role is checked on every Home screen load — try pulling down to refresh

*Built for Jefferson Nascimento and the worship team.*
*Both apps require the sync server to be running for any cross-app features to work.*
