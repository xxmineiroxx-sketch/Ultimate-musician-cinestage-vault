# LIVE MODE v2.6 – Cue Editor (ProPresenter-Style Workflow)

## Purpose
Provide a cue-based live control system aligned with ProPresenter thinking but optimized for audio-first worship/live music.

## Cue Types
- SECTION (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro)
- TEMPO (BPM changes)
- CLICK (on/off)
- GUIDE (vox guide on/off)
- AUTOMATION (Mixer / FX / Snapshot)
- MEDIA (Pad / Loop / FX hit)

## Cue Editor Rules
- Cues are ordered vertically (timeline)
- Only ONE cue is “ARMED” at a time
- Organizer edits, Stage executes
- Live mode = read-only cues

## Execution Flow
1. Organizer builds Service Plan
2. Cues auto-generated per song
3. Manual edits allowed
4. Stage view receives immutable cue list
5. Live operator triggers NEXT / PREV

## ProPresenter Parity
- Slide = Cue
- Arrangement = Cue Stack
- Timeline optional (not required)

## Fail-Safe
- If cue fails → continue audio
- Visual cues never block audio

Status: ✅ Designed, ready for implementation
